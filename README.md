There are two files in this repository. One contains the .py file and other is an output file

The .py file scrapes the jobTitle and jobId for Amazon's recent Business Intelligence open positions in Seattle, USA since Amazon is headquarted in Seattle, USA and hence majority of the positions are based in the location. The idea behind scraping is to extract all recent positions and automate the applying process once the data is completely extracted.
